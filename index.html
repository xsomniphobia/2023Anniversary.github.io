    <h1>Happy Anniversary Honey Bunches </h1>
    <p> Happy 3 years honey, I know this might be a bit odd of a present but I remember you said we didn't have pictures together and it gave me an idea. just in case something happens I don't want to lose all of our photos so I thought maybe I could digitize all of them and put them on a site. It's a site for us. I've known you for all the formative years of my life, you knew me before I even knew myself and we've gotten to grow and learn and experience life together. I'm not always good with the whole words thing or sometimes I get total tunnel vision and forget to tell you how much you mean to me. But honey you mean everything to me.You are my anything and everything, you are the person who makes me feel safe, you are the love of my life.
     So as the years go by and we get new phones or if something happens and we lose our polaroids I want them to be immortalized here because I have every intention of spending my life with you and I don't want to lose any of it. I want to be in our 80's looking at our pictures from Toronto remmbering all the adventures we had. I love you so much and nothing will ever change that. Also I apologize for the site looking kinda janky I am but early into my web design skills and haven't quite mastered the art of aesthetics but at least I'm dating an artist so you can do all the art stuff I'll just write the code.</p>
